Manuscript EJP-105403
List of changes:


* Section 1 is partly rewritten in response to Referee #3 and reference to
  Kitano has been added.

* Section 2 is partly rewritten in response to Referee #3 to motivate and
  explain the unusual notation.

* The example of previous section "Tensors" has been simplified and moved
  to a separate section 3.

* In section 6, after equation (24), an explanation is given for the
  integral rule, in response to Referee #3.

* At the end of section 12, references have been added to recent works in
  dimensional analysis, in response to Referee #3.

* In the title I have replaced "general relativity" with "relativity" since
  the work applies to the special and general theory
