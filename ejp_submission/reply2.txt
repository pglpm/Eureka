EJP-105403.R1 - Reply to Referee 3

I thank the Referee for the additional comments.

I have amended the text regarding the first and third points, see pages 4
and end of page 12.

Regarding the second point I disagree. The manifold in the example of
Section 2 is a spacetime manifold. Its points are events. Temperature and
entropy are scalar fields defined in a region of this spacetime manifold.
These fields allow us - in this specific region - to uniquely *label* each
spacetime event. They can therefore be used as coordinates. (I'm not saying
that they can be always used this way, or over the whole spacetime;
coordinate systems can be defined in limited domains.) Something similar is
done in atmospheric or ocean dynamics, where longitude, latitude, and
pressure (or mass density) are sometimes used as coordinates (we're of
course speaking of resolutions of kilometres, not metres). I have now tried
to explain this point more clearly on pages 5-6.

Best regards,
the author
